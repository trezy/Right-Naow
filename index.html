  Right Naow
</header>

<main>
  <p>The app is called "Right Naow." The idea is that I want to host frozen margarita night at my place... right now. Normally I'd send out a mass text message with all of the details and just hope that I got all of the right people on the list. If I don't want to risk missing anybody I could set up a Facebook and invite everybody but then I know that I'm going to have to push it off to another day. That sucks. With Right Naow I just open the app, add a new event with a name, and I'm done. The event gets pushed to anybody that's allowed to see it and is within range.</p>

  <p>Alternatively, I'm bored and want to do something. I could see what's going on with Meetup.com, or I could log in and check out my Facebook calendar, or maybe I could just send texts out to random people to see what they're up to. All those options suck. With Right Naow you open the app and get a list of things that are happening right now within your range.</p>
